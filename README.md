# Bank Marketing
Analyzing whether direct marketing campaigns leads to bank term deposit

## Install
This project is built using Python and the following Python libraries:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit-Learn
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- imblearn

As this is a ipynb file, you will need a software to run the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/sriganeshlokesh/bank_marketing/blob/master/bank_marketing.ipynb)

If Python is not installed on your computer, it is highly recommended to install [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
The Anaconda Distribution contains all the above packages and more installed.

## Code

The notebook file for this project is `bank_marketing.ipynb`. The model is built using scikit-learn's Random Forest Classifer with the implementation of pipeling.

## Run

In a terminal or command window, run the following commands:
```python
jupyter notebook bank_marketing.ipynb
```
or

```python
ipython notebook bank_marketing.ipynb
```
This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your web browser.

## Data

Dataset used in this project is `bank-full.csv` (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones).
We will using Random Forest Classifier as a base model and apply GridSearchCV to tune the Hyperparameters by consolidating it with pipeling.
